Implementation of Network Streaming Session Management and Control
System in Distributed Environment.

We developed unified media streaming session management and control system in
diversing AV device, video format and processing.

Media streaming over the Internet by end users for various purposes are
now pupular, because of popularization of degital video devices and
broadband detalink.
Informationg sharing method and application dependent format are the
problems for Media streaming between end users.
In contents creation and delivery system, many devices and application
are combined.
In this environment, cotroling a information which is required for media
streaming and unified control method is required.

In this research, we provided following functional capability
negotiating as media streaming information via internet.
- automatic management server search.
- visiualization managed session information
- unified control interface based on gathered streaming information.

We set management server per broadcast domain to detect automatically
by end nodes, and management servers share these end nodes' information
using Any Source.

In streaming system, session was binding on streaming elements and its
application. This system realized unified and autonomous session
management.
We also proposed one of global domain service location system.
